'work fine the other blink intermittently already no longer working after minimal use i bought and they worked great for week then they quit working wa using in a hot humid climate new battery didn t help price is too good to be true don t expect them to last one of mine just died and the other only flash it s been month so i can t return not happy good luck terrible they stop working not a bright a i thought it would be these light seem to have issue after a little use but a to be expected from a low priced light it s good a a light for the kid or in a tool box but don t plan on performance great little flash lite after a long time of carrying these disappointment i am glad to say i can buy a new flash light they are okay for throw away flash light but they are very undependable and aren t really worth keeping for more than a week i run a small business that requires me to constantly use a flash light and i bought these a a test run after about a week they started going in and out i replaced the battery and still it only worked about of the time i m not a picky person but these had a pretty bad short in their switch so i just kept them in a drawer and used them intermittently glad to say though they are finally dead a a door nail and i can replace them with something a lot better u get what u pay for both flash light stopped operating in le than a week i have had excellent service life from other led merchant no excuse for such dismal performance steven belau one wa broken button turn on selects through mode won t turn off but the other is just fine good buy for the price but are not a bright a other flashlight on this site these rockbirds w led mini tactical flashlight are not that bright but many led flashlight are really too bright for most us they use a lens to give a highly focused beam which isn t very good for just walking around i like that they don t need special battery just aa no instruction a to how to open and replace battery they did not light when button wa pressed junk one had the on off button quit working after a few us and the other won t turn on half the time oh yeah and sometimes it just blink and blink and won t shut off have to take battery out to shut it off very cheap light doe not go very far in dark you get what you pay for fast shipment dropped it one time from about ft on to dirt and the piece that focus the light broke will not buy these ever again the low price is the only reason i am giving this flashlight a star rating instead of a star rating this is not bright at all even on the high setting the metal finish on the one i received is spotty and not finished not impressed at all they look nice but bad quality they rarely come on when u push the button have to twist the battery cover part to get it to work i bought these to use a a bike headlight my commute to work is about min which i do by bike after dark x wk i always used the strobe because it is more conspicuous and drain the battery le than a steady beam and is legal for a bike headlight in florida at first i wa very happy with the brightness but after wks the light would require many click of the switch to turn on then it would go dark during my trip and afterwards it wouldn t come on at all this started after a total use of le than hr in strobe function and the battery still had plenty of charge i tried the nd light and had a similar experience not wanting to continue risking my life i tried to return the item but it wa not eligable i am very dis satisfied didn t work even tried several battery i wa very disappointed with these flashlight the very first time i pushed the button to turn on the button collapsed in apparently they can t be returned which is awesome these are very cheaply made once of these broke after us if i could give this product a zero i would absolutely terrible trash have yet to work properly wish i could have returned them i wouldn t recommend this to anyone what a waste of money these thing looked like they d be great and i liked the adjustability of the beam angle but they both stopped working within week of being used i ve had lower quality cheaper crap from the dollar store last longer than these i only rated them star because there isnt an option for zero star or even negative star one broke the other wa lost these are decent light to keep around the house or in the car they aren t super high quality one of mine the rubber cover over the on off switch wa installed wrong and it make it hard to operate the light i don t think they are really lumen either i have a lumen light that i compared it to and these are a lot dimmer good cheap flashlight i really liked these until they just broke about a month after use changing battery and then never worked again same for both flashlight in pack light is weak the strobe light is pointless and maybe just barely worth expected more quality but it s all look one did not work switched the tail cap and they both work for now it give a good amount of light but star because now i can t rely on the light i gave it star because only one of the flash light worked it didnt seem worth it to send them back since i really only needed one for a christmas gift just seemed easier and cheaper to get the two pack i put the battery in and one worked right away while the other only pretend to work if the spring touch the side wall while the battery is in it and that s impossible to use since you have to close the cap to keep the battery inside the one that work however is awesome and more than what i expected it to be flash zoom and expands and is very bright for it small size just wish the other one worked overall happy with the one that work but disappointed only one worked i ordered similar light to this in the past loved them these however constantly cycle the feature each time you turn the light on for example first time you turn it on super bright next time dim mode next time flashing pattern normally these type of flashlight should function momentary press button change mode turn unit off remembers where it wa the st flashlight i used at work fell apart in my pocket the barrel that focus the light stripped out the inner thread i will try the nd light this week well one worked great the other one did not work since day one wa not so bright and just went off got a new battery and turned on and then off dead now so i would not buy did i mention that we got hit by maria yeah and really needed it fairly dim also you have to adjust the tension of the battery cap just so if you tighten it all the way the flashlight wont function usually inconsistent one of the flash light stop working after about a month to use it seems like the switch problem to something internal not recommendable one doa second one can t use button to turn light off i wa expecting too much out of these little guy ad say lumen if im remembering correctly id say theyre more around lumen have scratched lens which isnt too much of an issue but considering theyre scratched on the inside it could come a a concern to others expect what you pay for these started malfunctioning after us really cheaply made expect to have these break very fast not bright at all but handy enough would not buy again why to small i guess i need to read description better or measure better these are sooooo small they work ok too but just to sarn small even though the wide angle give a decent spray of light with a fresh battery these light struggled to light the bush from yard away that doe not mean if you want to use these baby in the attic while checking the rat trap you wont have great light but when you zoom the lens for a tighter beam you ll find a square which is emitted by the led module crystal which is okay for kid but not great if you need to really see that thing that is right there lookin back at you all in all this is great deal for a four pack of flashlight that you can give to the kid for a camping trip to keep them all on the same wave but if you re looking for something else to keep you out of the dark and give yourself a chance to stay ahead of the critter try something else very small in size like inch at most good for purse or kid backpack they work well tho weak work fine for close up lighting but distance is a problem not the brightest either have to press the button repeatedly to cycle through the option the build quality is great and they were very useful during hurricane harvey but one of the flashlight in the pack wa defective and is hard to get it working i thought the flashlight wa good but i did not know that it flicker and i can t use it for the intended purpose which is to seat guest in a performing art center kind of disappointed i got this in june of this year after le than four month it s broken something is rattling around inside it won t zoom in all the way any more and there are two rubber band like thing that i m guessing used to be inside the flashlight and are very likely related to why it isn t working any more my work backpack ha a pocket on the shoulder strap it had been in that pocket for maybe a month before i discovered it had broken this flashlight is not rugged not even a little if clipping it on an office worker s backpack for a month break something well let s just say i m glad i didn t get into a situation where i wa relying on this light very glad oh and nothing at all on this product offering about warranty how to return it etc honestly i wouldn t accept a replacement only a refund one other and le important gripe the pocket clip is way too rigid and is really hard to get on anything that s why i put it on the pocket on my backpack shoulder strap i couldn t even get the clip over the edge of my jean pocket without using a tool to pry it open move on get something else anything a glow stick would be better and last longer unable to open battery cap of flashlight contacted supplier still no response worst product service very dim not worth the money one would not work amazon returned it don t like the strobe light function one work great and the other ha a disfunction when trying to use the spot light it won t stay in place and i manually have to hold it ridiculously small you are mislead by the picture on the site not a bright a the solaray one i have these always want to start out flashing so i have to remember to push button twice update both flashlight have ceased working after le than a month so the verdict is do not buy this product fantastic little flashlight very bright and love the zoom feature i use it to walk dog in the dark and it is perfect they re bright but very small get the job done tho only one work the one that doe is mediocre at best so i wa hoping for a durable metal flashlight that had better than average candle power what i got wa essentially a flashlight with a metal casing first impression were it wa alittle lighter than i imagined the light wa not even that bright i dug out a harbor freight led flashlight and compared the on my basement wall the h freight one out shined the rockbird one easily not terrible enough to junk or return a small metal casing flashlight could come in handy but when i need a bright light i wont be reaching for this pure crap they end up in garbage can two day after arrival very low quality i use the flashlight with a battery the flashlight work well however one of the flashlight ha failed i guess you get what you pay for these are decent light for the price but are not lumen more like compared it to a lumen i already have and it not even a bright theyre flashlight not incredible not bad doe not work poor quality i thought these would be pretty decent like the j tactical flashlight but they are not the reflector and inside of one ha already come apart and is not easily repairable one worked and the other would not light doe not go on sometimes and sometimes it switch itself into strobe mode on it own one of the two light had a defective switch the one working light is lower quality than similar product i have seen but is bright enough i like the size and that it take just one aa battery i ll keep this in my office for emergency use during power outage i d gotten these previously and it wa time to get a few more i wa happy with the initial batch but while they re intelligently designed the quality of the last batch i got wasn t great of the didn t function properly though i will say the price is pretty exceptional after the first time using the flashlight it fell out of my pocket and it hasnt worked since these seem solid and good quality however after using for one camping trip right out of the box the power button mode selector on the flashlight ha developed a short it is indecisive on whether or not it will turn on at all when clicked and the half click to change mode guarantee it shuts off and you re hard pressed to get it to turn back on again i should have been thorough about putting these through the pace during the return window before trying to rely on them neither flashlight worked checked my battery in another light problem with rockbirds flashlight honestly not worth it i tried to use them for work and they worked half the time the light would randomly start to change then just stop working just stay away from these they are okay but not very bright if only using regular battery don t get these unless you want to invest in the extra powerful battery charger this doesn t put out nearly the light that the duracell put out with aaa battery i use rechargables very small which wa awesome and it wa doing what i bought it for until the light stopped turning on flashlight seem to have a mind of there own these would work good for around the house and emergency use but not for any type of work long period of off and on usage these flashlight had high and low beam a well flasher my only complaint their size looking at the picture i wa expecting something bigger no durability both of them broke quickly after purchase not a bright a expected one very irritating feature is that pressing the on button cycle through the flashlight s mode so whenever you turn it on it turn on in low light strobe or high in that order not real bright good light and feel sturdy but way smaller than expected these are totally unreliable most of the time they don t on when you need them to bought these to put in my hurricane preparedness kit they are ok they feel solid and the brightness is fine however when i put in the battery and tightened the cap the light came on and stayed on despite depressing the button i loosened the cap a bit and it worked properly but it seems like a design flaw not the best flashlight i ve purchased but i got two for so for the price they are ok based on the good review i bought this pack of two flashlight in preparation for hurricane irma a i live in central florida one of the two in the pack is defective the on off switch doe not work so that the light shine a soon a the battery is in and it can not be turned off without taking out the battery they are not a bright a i thought it would be but it s still a great price for the amount of flashlight you receive horrible light the light change mode with any bump of the flashlight i can not keep them on one mode without them changing mode from power saving to flashing to high beam every single bump or vibration will change mode and cause the lid to come off and the battery pop off cheap and not worth the money one of the four flashlight doesn t work the others are fine but disappointing to have one be defective actually a second one ha stopped working i am going to see if i can contact the seller very unhappy with these they feel cheap and one look like it s been damaged and now i find out that i can t return them no return and that s no good small flashlight with okay light not something i d use except maybe to find my way to the bathroom in the middle of the night i ordered these last week and after putting a battery in the first one thought it seemed like a good product especially liking the small size i tried putting a battery in the second one and it will not close apparently the groove are stripped so it will not hold the end which secures the battery i tried to return and today discovered they are not eligible for return so i have one flashlight instead of two i am wondering how long this one will last the button doesn t seem to have an actuation point so you seem to have to press rather firmly to change light setting but some time it actuates with little pressure edge on the frame feel uncomfortable flashlight are ok better than i expected can t really beat flashlight for the price only had for a few day but so far so good nd review haven t had the flash light longs and starting to not work thought wa good first week then work half the time they aren t very bright and only turn on half the time don t waste your money one of them the thread holding the battery cap in stripped the first time that i took it off opened the box grabbed one of the flashlight twisted the top off placed the battery seemed to work pretty good then i grabbed the other flashlight twisted the twisted the stuck top pull the top wd the top twist the top while holding the body with plier threw in trash the top wa welded on and stripped so badly there wa nothing i could do to open it and place the battery if you re going to seal it shut at least provide the battery ridiculous don t buy these little flashlight when i got them one of the button on the back of the flashlight doesn t work and this product did not allow return fair value very cheap and functional work well good for the vehicle a ok flashlight for the price good for fishing hunting and outdoor activity like the fact that it s made with a metal material very bright love the belt clip good product these thing are junk they work for about minute and then they die not battery dead just dead don t waste your money i bought these flashlight to keep in the glove box of both car to use in case of an emergency they both failed only after using them several time the product is garbage and i threw both of them away not even worth the hassle of packaging them back up to send back you get what you pay for i guess one worked fine but the other heated up to an unsafe temperature hot enough we removed the battery and disposed of it if we had left it much longer it could have been seriously bad news not a expected wa really excited for these light poor quality the on off button on one is failing it doesn t turn on and the others internals aren t holding together where it should slide to zoom very disappointed in this product the flashlight haven t been very durable the back button get s kind of finicky where you have to click it several time for it to turn back on i have to buy battery china junk these are cheap knockoff of a more quality product not very bright not worth the money used around time already stopped working when you can get it to turn on it go from high to low to flashing all by it self they don t work i bought them for a trip and they don t work what a waste of money got both light and wa excited about them from the description one would not hold battery because the thread were stripped the other would not zoom focus light the description stated it could very disappointing to say the least came a a pack one flashlight only turn on in dim mode flash and high mode no longer work wa used on two or three time the second one still work they did not come with any info one doe not work flashlight would not turn off and almost burned my hand it seems there is a short and the battery power is turned into heat in the handle one worked one did not work complete junk worked for like a day they are cool decent enough light but i hated the fact that i had to cyclce through the mode every time i turned it on a arrived upon inserting the battery the flashlight didn t turn on only of the flashlight worked the second flashlight trash bought two of these liked them enough to order four more recently opened a two pack of the second one i ordered good light overall not great disappointed to find out one flashlight doesn t work out of the box brand new would ve given five star based on the value not an extremely bright light but better than average considering price they also burn through aaa battery quickly can t get past only getting half of what i paid for that kill the value part that compensated for the average brightness too small for regular use they are listed a mini though the flashlight description stated online doe not match the actual product the product zoom is completely different a stated in the picture shown a what it actually doe will keep flashlight but not happy description and actually product function do not match not bad one of them doesn t turn on anymore and not sure why battery is good and all connection seem good only one out of the two worked something in the switching mechanism that turn the light on and off did not work only one of the two i received work correctly one of them doe the hi and lo and strobe the other one shine a light only china this didn t work at all when i got them and they didn t refund me the price i paid i don t like the mode that it force you to cycle through i have to click through dim and flasher mode before i get to the regular bright mode which is all i wanted in the first place for the price it s a marginally ok product quick shipping flash light is week compared to other lumen flash light this may be due to the fact that it us a single aa battery not recomended these flashlight are not actually lumen they are not even lumen when compared to other lumen and a lumen flashlight i found that with new battery at it highest setting folly zoomed in wa still visibly dimmer than the lumen flashlight i bought the two pack and compared both to each other with both new alkaline and fully charged nickle cadmium rechargeable battery and found that they do not even match each other in brightness they re inexpensive and were the compact size i wa looking for but it seems you get what you pay for and in this case you pay for under lumen one work fine the other wa doa one of the flashlight switch doe not work one failed within day the on off switch stopped working i did not expect much from this light at this price but i did expect it to last longer than one day it did not little rust inside and poor quality just received these today so far so good not super bright but not bad either they feel a little flimsy so not sure how long they will hold up about what you d expect for definitely wouldn t spend more than that doe not return to bright after powering off full click cycle through mode the same way that half click do brightness seems below what is advertised will likely return incredibly dim the rubber on the button is warped and bubbled i found metal shaving in the threading of the battery chamber did i mention that it is so dim it s pathetic i wa going to give this a a gift but after trying it out i would be so ashamed if i had given it other than the metal shaving warped rubber button and a pretty poor battery fit it doe feel like it doe feel like it is a well built flashlight too bad that it so weak at actually producing light the flashlight were defective when received one could not be opened to insert a battery cheap and unreliable i know they were not expensive one unit work great it will be good for my tool box at work the other the lens is messed up and not half a bright a the first so in closing dosnt work for me to be honest i m not impressed i m comparing these to my streamlight protac which is also lumen firstly at first glance the construction seems fine quality of material is ok secondly there is no way in hell that these flashlight are lumen i d wager that they aren t even lumen not bright at all doa and this item is not eligible for return only received one light in my order the one light is nice for the price but i paid for two one of the three flashlight did not work they aren t bad light really bright lightly depress the switch and release to change the operating mode i just happened to get one with a bad switch it pop loudly occasionally doesn t work or won t turn off the other flashlight is fine oh the fluorescent line those are silicone rubber band that glow in the dark when using for any amount of time these get really warm in your hand great if you want to warm your hand in say alaska can t even get a battery in it and it s not bright at all once i finally got the top open it just kept spinning and spinning now i can t get the battery out of the flashlight work but not a advertised did not find the nonreturnable part until after receiving the item rechecked the original page for the order and nowhere doe it say nonreturnable waste of my money way smaller than i thought my fault i wa hoping the flashlight would be brighter based on the description but it s not a bright a advertised they re very small but work well for a inch flashlight it s okay not impressed these aren t much better than the dollar store flashlight not very bright a the high dollar flashlight are really cheaply made and flimsy the light is bright and there s a flimsy lense you can move to adjust the beam not bad all in all but not great you get what you pay for short and sweet one worked one didn t they re pretty dim granting powered off a single aaa battery that s only v their rather small size is appealing for storage in an automobile or a purse i suppose those were the purchase design here anyway or it s highly unlikely would have gone this route contacted the company twice indicating one worked one didn t idk yet if they ve responded i don t manage this account my wife s account and i m the occasional buyer that said looking at the order history there s no clear amazon indication that any adjustment have been made lastly seems one can reasonably expect a hit miss scenario with these notice the irregular pricing strongly nudging a buyer toward a larger collection to whit we bought a pack for now i see both that same pack but also a pack for caveat emptor delivery and packaging wa great but the item is poor quality cheap feeling although it ha a metal body when screwing on the cap to battery compartment the metal sheered on the thread i do not imagine it will be very long lasting the light is good though the pinpoint beam i expected would be more spot focused it is still a fairly wide beam nice for a small every day use because they were each that got them one star because they worked they got another because they did not work properly two star is all they are worth of the two one worked perfectly the other would only switch on in dim mode and needed to be switched to bright mode they are build solidly and the working one doe a good job amazon customer service is perfect a always and resolved the issue to my satisfaction i would try them again my guess is i just got a bad one yes just ok run on a single aa battery ok light in a pinch we re not talking about a zillion lumen by any stretch but click the button the light go on simple three mode mechanism adjustable bezel push pull to adjust beam size flood setting look best but not the brighest worth the buy in case of an emergency besides aa battery are cheaper than dirt and so easy to find the battery in both flashlight were no good it took aaa battery not happy i wasn t able to open one of them to insert a battery very poor design with the battery portal being combined with a light adjustment feature at the top it just turn and turn a though the battery portal is stripped what a piece a crap it wa a waste of time trying to open it and an even bigger waste of money in addition the strobe function should work off an exterior switch that can be activated when the light is on not when you turn it off and then turn it back on only to have a useless strobe function activated that requires you to turn off the light again and turn it back on just to activate it normal function one agitated customer don t let the edgy design fool you very poor light for a flash light give off a much a much light a a dollar harbor freight pack one of the two light i received doe not work i didnt know it wa not returnable before receiving it one worked the second one i could not get it open to put the battery in so do not know if it work or not one good one bad save your money if you drop them they don t shut off anymore both are broke in le then a week ok for a kid one out of the two work it did not light up when the battery wa a applied it just over heated ordered package flashlight total one of the push button toggle switch work only when it feel like it and it s not often it feel like it the other flashlight work okay but i wonder how long before their push button toggle switch crap out this is the first time in year of shopping with amazon that a product we purchased doesn t work i guess it wa bound to happen sooner or later it s not worth the hassle to send a flashlight back it should be thrown away but then i m throwing away of my money it s not the money it s the principle come on amazon just suck it up and mail me a working replacement these flashlight are ok nothing special for a cheap a they are i don t suppose you can set your sight too high very disappointing one of the light doesn t open but the one that work is very bright so the one i could open to put a battery work ok but the other one doesn t unscrew so it useless not a great deal update minute later after taking the battery out and trying to reassemble the one that worked the housing which hold the lens over the led came off so garbage stay away absolute junk received the light today light doe not telescope at all the other turn to strobe whenever you put it down on a hard surface overall it is well built for the price however the max output is probably not even lumen to call this lumen is such false advertisement it is bright enough to do the job and aa battery are easy to find and they are cheap enough to loose or keep around they cheap so they don t get held to super high standard the slide to amplify light is only useful when at max power the light get focused into some logo i can t make out not good or bad just an observation one of the two work fine the other one doe not work at all it doesn t click it seems all empty inside the orange ball where it is supposed to click on and off cheap stuff not worth to send back i had bought a pair similar to these previously and really like the design this brand however wa cheapened considerably i wa not impressed with the switch most of all being not a crisp a the other brand dropped the light one time now the slightest change in grip will turn it to strobe or off but it s bright when turning these on you get a different mode each time who want a flashlight that shine a random mode each time i use the same mode of the time so have to change mode every time i turn it on no thanks the zoom doe not work on any of the flashlight i received i do not recommend this flashlight don t use to often very bright broken spring not making good contact after changing battery ii initially gave it star but changed it after it stopped working loved it at first but after dropping it once the flashlight will not turn on i tried replacing the battery and looking inside to see if i could fix it i don t see any way'
