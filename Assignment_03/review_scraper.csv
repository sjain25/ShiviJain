9,9,James G. Demian,Was this review helpful to you?, April 10 2018,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Wow. Nicely made. Work very well with Li Ion 14500 batteries as well as with AA alkaline (of course dimmer). Not hard to get used to the (stupid) inclusion of Strobe Mode. They automatically cycle from mode to mode each time you turn them off/on with the tail switch. Hint to make your life easier (such as it is): When (not if) it turns on automatically (every third time) in strobe mode, just gently push down slightly once or twice on the switch to make it cycle between modes to get what you want. Instead of ""jumping up and down, screaming and shouting"", just think ZEN thoughts (Ooooommmm. All is beauty) and gently depress the switch.

And think of the amazingness of this: A bright (and cheap and well-made) LED flashlight that operates on one lousy battery at 1 1/2 volts (yes, even cheap light ""heavy duty"" non-alkalines) or an NiMH rechargeable at 1.35 volts and yet is still not destroyed by 3.7 volt Li Ion's. Would I be as enthusiastic if I'd not got them on sale at 6.99? Well, maybe a little less because the competition in quantity goes for about $3 to $4 per, and if I buy 5 or 6, I'd be giving away a few to friends and that would be even more fun.

One little nit-picky thing: the ""Two Fluorescent Rings Which Shine in the Dark Night"" (not fluorescent but phosphorescent) the ""rings"" seem to be just those (cheap) little silicone rubber bands sold in handi-craft stores that are woven together (mainly by younger people, it seems) to make rings and bracelets. Yeah, some of those are sold as glow-in-the-dark. My point is that after a few minutes in the dark, I've seen matches brighter than these -yeah UNLIT matches!

One more thing - if you use 14500 Li Ion batteries: EBL 14500 Li-ion Rechargeable Batteries 3.7V 800mAh for LED Flashlight Torch, 8 Packs most of these are what is called ""unprotected"". In this case, it means if their voltage goes down in the flashlight, they are probably going to be damaged and may never again be able to be charged to full capacity - or at all. So this is my suggestion: if the ""bulb"" starts dimming or shuts off by itself: immediately open the flashlight and take out the battery. That way the flashlight cannot draw down its voltage any more. Since there's no circuit to protect your battery, you have to do it. This should help you protect your investment and continue to give you the nice bright light these batteries give with these flashlights.","Well-made, bright, and good deal."

Generally, I've been quite pleased with the quality and price.

That said, the Cree Q5 adjustable focus LED flashlights I received from this vendor are of poor quality overall.
I ordered 20 of the flashlights and 15 of them must have been seconds or even third quality.

The hex head screws on some of the clips have been replaced with Phillips head screws and even these Phillips head screws were damaged from the install .... like they were forced in.

Some of the lights have mix-n-match screws, others not. Many of the lights showed scratches from previous use. Not what I expected ... not even close.

Even the boxed packaging with bubblewarap inserts shows signs of previous use - tape pulled off, crushed, etc.

Generally, I think this lot of Cree Q5 LED was of poor quality (2nds or worse) as I said above.

I personally wouldn't order from this vendor ever again - no mater what the price stated.

BEWARE, some of the vendors for these flashlights are better that others ... this one seems to sell items of poor quality and passes them off as 1st quality. They are not even close.

I hope this information from an experienced customer of these flashlights helps.
I read these reviews to help me make an informed decision - I hope you do as well. They have proved quite handy.

If I should receive any satisfaction from this seller I will do what I can to update this review to something better.
I don't expect that I will though. We'll see ...

It can be focused, but there is no way to hold the focus so it just slides around. I wrapped rubber bands around mine. Great x-mas stocking stuffer.

Oh, its bright, but not 300 lumens. Its a single AA battery after all.

Update: I read a few more reviews and there was a lot of talk about being able to dim these lights by a half press on the button like most flashlights.

I tried it on the 2 that I have and they definitely do not dim. Maybe the latest batch do? Once again, its cheap and bright, but dont expect too many features from a $3.50 flashlight.","Bright, cheap but its a $3 flashlight after all.."

1,1,Jerr,2 people found this helpful. Was this review helpful to you?, November 14 2013,1.0 out of 5 stars,"These flashlights are junk. They are supposed to work on either AA or Rechargeable 3.6V batteries. If you put the AA battery in there is very dim light. No better than a pen light you can pick up anywhere. If you put in the rechargeable battery, the flashlight only works for 10 minutes, gets hot and quits. I bought the first 3 lights from EggDeal. It took 5 weeks to receive them, and they looked like a quality product. So, I went back to the same location and ordered 5 more, for gifts. In addition I ordered rechargeable batteries and a charger. The 5 I received this time (Tosol 8888) were garbage. No names on the sides, poor paint jobs, dirty lenses and rough machining. The rechargeable batteries wouldn't work in these lights either, and they were even dimmer on AA's than the first batch.

6,6,Ken,Was this review helpful to you?, November 10 2013,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I don't tend to like magnifier focus flashlights but for under four bucks, I figured I'd get a few extra flashlights. These are fine. Of the three I received one of them seems to have a poorly threaded end cap, but it gets on there... QC, through Quantity, I guess they call it. Not going to bother with returns etc... as it works, and it wasn't worth any hassle sending it back. Magnifier is typical for a flashlight of this type. You can focus it until you can see the outline of the LED chip on the wall. Brightness is just average. My take is it's good for extras to throw in the tackle box or glove box, Nice for <$4 stocking stuffers, but of course, not even close to replacing a decent EDC type light (and of course, nowhere near the price). Ok for what it is, worth the price, don't expect more.","Inexpensive, ""cheap"", but they work."

3,3,Davey B.,2 people found this helpful. Was this review helpful to you?, October 6 2013,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I've owned three of these flashlights to date. The first one lasted about 9 months. I used it on the job, working in mechanical and boiler rooms, and it had a couple of moderate falls (4 feet or less). It continued working after those falls, but one day I found it simply wouldn't turn on. Looking inside the battery tube, it looks as if the surface where the positive terminal of the battery is supposed to contact has been worn away. Can't say for sure what happened, but I ordered two to replace it. They are cheap enough that I'd rather have a backup than have one fail and be caught without a light source.

These are very tactical looking, but they are NOT built with tactical uses in mind. I certainly wouldn't trust my life to one of these lights. They are great for the money, but you do get what you pay for. Speaking of which, this light is nowhere near 300 lumens on a standard AA alkaline battery. With a lithium battery, it's definitely brighter, but it's still not 300 lumens. I'd highly recommend using a lithium cell with this light, both for the brightness advantages and for the ability to recharge your battery since these will run through a standard AA decently quick.

Last thing to mention - I LOVE the beam adjustment of this light. It's extremely easy to operate one-handed, and you can change the focus of the beam very quickly since you are pushing/pulling the lens assembly instead of turning it. This also lends itself well to being able to maintain a better grip on the light while adjusting the beam. At the tightest focus, you do get a square light pattern like you see in some of the customer images, but I've grown to like that. On a dark night, it's like having a miniature spot light, the beam focuses so tightly.","Nice budget flashlight, but needs lithium battery to really come alive"
4,4,D. Williams,2 people found this helpful. Was this review helpful to you?, October 3 2013,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Here are a few words: You won't believe what this thing does with its self-generated light!

After one, count 'em one AA battery (who cares if it's not provided!) is slipped into this little giant and it's put all together again, the push of a rubber-protected red button (about 3/4 the size of a man's thumb pad) on the opposite end of a case containing a convex lense and ""let their be light"" just seems an inadequate description.

The SODIAL Hausbell Mini Cree LED Flashlight Torch (got enough words in there? Might be room for a couple more) shines by using an adjustable focus convex lense that delivers a nearly gradient-free light beam that when held three-feet high broadcasts a 24"" diameter, really, truly round light beam. Remember the shadows in other flashlights that seem to hit at exactly the WRONG place? This has none. Period. None.

If you need a pinpoint beam, well, this does a darn decent job, too. A user can easily discern individual chunks of pine bark on a tree 50-feet away. At twice that distance the penetrating bean shines well into whatever woods may be in front of it.

Already having one spot too many burnt on my retina, I'm not about to try a ""blinding"" light. But I'll bet it does. Enough, one fears, to blind an intruder or attacker. Really. But keep in mind that a youngin' lacking sense may also blind himself or another person. So keep this thing out of such hands.

It give a nice light even when try it with a used AA regular battery ( not the chargeable kind ).
For home use or car check or outdoor for close area, it's really a nice choice for it's price. 300lm or 200lm or whatever it says, the bright of this light is far enough to let you see in the dark. and for it's price, it's a must to be in your car/home.

Addition: I would like to add that the one mode that this flashlight has, is a good feature, as sometimes it's annoying when you want to turn on/off the flashlight and you have to go through all the modes. so I found it having one mode as a good feature for me ( I already have another head flashlight with different modes, it's nice, but need to press the button 3 times to turn it off) this one is not and i start to like it this way.",Great for it's price

If there are any flaws it is in the switch, which isn't able to turned on without clicking it all the way on. Some other lights can be turned on with a half-press of the switch, but not this one. The click of the switch is also relatively loud, which makes it a poor fit for stealthy needs.

2,2,Mike Moore,Was this review helpful to you?, June 8 2013,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I ordered five of these little buggers because for the price, they're cheaper than many disposable flashlights.

They just arrived today, so this is just my initial impression of them for what it matters...

First, they seem to be solidly built. They are metal and while the construction may be a bit crude (screws holding the clip on), they don't feel cheap.

Secondly, the all worked. I read where a few people got inoperable ones, but I put AA batteries in all five and they worked as promised.

Thirdly, they are bright. Well, bright enough. They don't rival the much more expensive flashlight I primarily use on duty (especially when it comes to range), but for the inside of a vehicle or other closer confines they light everything up well and with a nice, clear white light.

Lastly, I like that they use inexpensive AA batteries and not CR123 ones like my main flashlight.

So, what's the down side? For one, I don't like the toggle switch being how you cycle through the beams (high, low and strobe). I wish it was only an off/on switch with a separate one for each cycle as it is on my considerably more expensive light; but for the price I can live with it.

Outside of that, these are great ""stashable"" flashlights in that for the price, you can buy many of them and stuff them where you might need them (in the car, in a drawer, in a jacket pocket, etc). I hope they last, I will be disappointed if they didn't. Otherwise, I suggest snatching up several of them.

Oh, and since they come from Asia, they will take several weeks to show up. Be patient, they're worth the wait.

8,8,J,One person found this helpful. Was this review helpful to you?, June 1 2013,2.0 out of 5 stars,"This is my fourth order of these Chinese SODIAL flashlights. The first order was excellent. They came in these little white boxes, covered with a bubble wrap bag, and had the high,low and strobe capability. The next two orders still had the boxes, but the adjustable light capability was gone. The light was either on or off now. That was OK as the quality of the unit was still high. This last order, and I emphasize last order, was crap.

I received the padded envelope in the mail and could tell something was different from the prior mailings. I cut open the pouch and there were no more little white boxes. Each light was only covered by the little bubble wrap bag that was in the boxes of prior shipments. This prompted me to look further. I have at least one of the lights from each of the prior orders and I compared them this final order. I noticed a pronounced drop in the quality of the light.

The sliding tube that holds the lens that focuses the light beam is very loose compared to my other lights. The on/off button seems cheaper. Even the spring on the button is smaller than my other lights. The final test I did was to compare the light beams with an older purchase using the same battery in each light. The beam produced by the new light seemed to be less intense and the focus was not as precise as on the older model.

The prior versions were a great buy for around 5 bucks. The current run is not. My suggestion is that you don't waste your money on these lights. My bet is that they will not last as long as the prior batch. I will keep this final purchase as it would cost as much as I paid for them to ship them back to China. My guess is that the cost of doing business in China is going up so the quality of their products will be decreasing. I hope this helps you save your hard earned money.",Quality is dropping.

9,9,iPolar Bear,Was this review helpful to you?, May 16 2013,5.0 out of 5 stars,"It was a love at first sight. Perfect pocket size, incredible design (military style), very durable (I dropped it many times and it still works), and very bright. I love the modes (full power, dimmed, and the strobe). Never seen a flashlight before with this type of adjustable focus (by ""stretching"" the flashlight), which I liked, too. It's been working on a single AA battery flawlessly for 3 months now (I use it for about 10 minutes a day, everyday). It's also very functional - I use it (actually two of them) for a night bicycle riding. I mounted them on the handlebar using rubber brackets (also available on Amazon for a few bucks) and it feels like I have two powerful headlights. The only minor thing that I would change about this flashlight is the mode sequence. If you are using a dimmed mode and you turn off the flashlight, and then you turn it on again, it goes to the next preset setting, which is a strobe light. I wish it stayed on dimmed. It's still my favorite flashlight, though. It beats many of my $40-$50 flashlights.
I was also considering the Ultrafire 1000 Lumen Cree 501b T6 LED Flashlight Torch (similar design) for only $5 more, but they come without the batteries. I did some research and found out that a decent charger with reliable batteries cost around $50. It would be probably to big to carry it in my pocket anyway, so I'm going to stick with this perfect little thing.
Even if it stops working tomorrow, I'm still going to give it five stars and order a new one. Even if it means ordering a new one every three months. Still worth every penny.","The best thing I've ever purchased for $5, hands down."

The picture on the product page....well, that person obviously has a very small hand, but the flashlight is still pretty tiny. It's about three inches from tip to tip. It takes one AA battery. I dont really use the adjustable focus, but a feature I really appreciate is the flashing light setting, achieved by half depressing the button. This is eminently useful when walking across the street when it's dark and there are cars around. A driver cant help but notice you. As far as the actual light output, it is very, very bright. I use this when I leave for work to walk down the stairs and out the driveway. It is obviously also very handy around the house. The only knock on this at all in my opinion is the belt clip. You will need to loosen the bolts, which honestly kind of defeats the purpose. Without doing so, you'll never get it open enough to clip onto anything.

Great construction. A solid, substantial flashlight, yet it's light, being aluminum.

LED, so great with batteries. Regular AA is plenty bright for 90% of the things you would use this for. The Dim setting is good for me when I'm out in the woods camping/partying, and I just turn it on dim and hang it off my belt. It lights the ground around me nicely. Can be used for 50% of the things you would need a flashlight for. The Strobe setting is useless to me.

The button is a click on/click off, not a momentary-on, which I prefer. Button seems solid, and it has a feature where you click it on, then if you press lightly, there's a secondary momentary switch that cycles between bright/dim/strobe.

The biggest problem I have with this flashlight is that that little momentary switch is activated every time you click the main switch. So instead of

Click on->Bright->Click off->Click on->Bright->Click off...

You get

Click on->Bright->Click off->Click on->Dim->Click off->Click on->Strobe->Click off->Click on->Bright.

Not as bright as another one but definitely brighter than these other lights bought at the store. I'm just running it on a aa. Only draw back is the length of time it took to get it. It was slow slow slow. Amazon goal was to shorten their shipping times by building warehouses and now charging taxes. This works against them.

I wrote to the seller hoping that I can get a replacement lens. It is very bright even with just a normal AA and not any special lithium battery. I like the three settings (high, low, and strobe) It also has O-rings on all of the seams so it might be somewhat water resistant but probably only to the extent that it an be used in light rain without breaking. The front of the light could be used as a glass break if it was necessary since it is sharp and just long enough it it is held right.

1,1,NS,15 people found this helpful. Was this review helpful to you?, February 10 2018,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Given my many prior, poor experiences with several of the low-price/knockoff CREE type LED, zoomable style flashlights I've bought of this design, these lights are a surprisingly good purchase. I've left off 1 of the 5 stars for 2 main reasons detailed in PRO's/CON's list below:
CONS:
1- Without (very) fresh batteries, the luminosity quoted in the product description isn't consistently provided by these lights- except on full, fresh batteries, the light is much dimmer than it can be when the light has fully powered batteries in it, so you'll end up going through batteries faster than normal (thankfully, the ""Amazon Basics"" AA batteries are very good quality & are very cheap compared to name-brands, so this is a solveable issue, just wasteful, seeing as you end up tossing batteries which still hold some charge- I've ended up using the 1/2 dead flashlight batteries in my cable box remotes in an effort not to waste them).
2- Like many of the economical flashlights being sold of this design type, sometimes the power-button press to cycle between modes happens without your input, turning on the strobe setting or the lower light output setting without my intending to do so by pressing the power button.
PROS:
1- These lights are very compact, yet with fully charged batteries, they have a high light output for their size. Given the amount of light they provide when fully powered, they do a good job to the point that my wife always keeps one in her purse & her car for being about at night &/or walking our dog after dark.
2- Unlike many of the other flashlights I've bought of this design/type, these lights have held up quality-wise over a decent amount of use- working just as they well as they did when they'd 1st arrived.
3- The price asked would be inexpensive for 1 CREE-type LED light of this design & high quality, so very good value for a 2 pack!

Overall I certainly recommend them if you're looking for a good, low-cost & compact CREE-type LED, zoomable flashlight which works well & is of good quality..","Miniature in size & price, but big on light output!"

The issue is with the switch logic. There is a single switch that turns it on/off (hard press) and changes the mode (half press). The problem is that each time you turn it on, it switches to the next mode. So if you are using it in “high” and turn it off, you will get “strobe” next time. Not a deal breaker, but annoying.

Well, I'm happy to say that it was brighter than expected and absolutely outshines any of the inexpensive, single-battery LED flashlights I've purchased over the last few years. It also is much brighter than the 8 or 9-LED models that use three AAA batteries. The light has a bit of a bluish tint, but not annoyingly so, by any means. With the adjustable lens fully forward, this baby will project a small, rectangular beam of light for over a hundred feet. Bring the lens back and it becomes a nice flood light. As others have mentioned, the lens just slides back and forth rather than staying in a secured position as it would if it were threaded. However, you'll likely not be using it much as a spotlight, anyway, due to the narrow beam.

There apparently are several types out there that look virtually identical and what I was expecting was the single on/off variety. What I actually received was the one that gives full brightness, off, reduced brightness, off, strobe and off for each push of the tail switch. Although this is an ordinary locking, click-on/click-off switch, there apparently is some circuitry that keeps track of the number of times the contacts open and close in a short period of time. In ordinary use, the light will always come on at full brightness and go off with the next push, just like a regular flashlight. I also tested it with a battery that was getting weak and, although dimmer, it still produced plenty of light

At 3.2 oz (with battery), this is heavier than I expected and is also fatter than other 1-AA lights. It appears to be quite rugged and that also goes for the clip, which is fastened by two screws. Not sure I'd want to carry this in a pocket for long periods of time--maybe on a belt, though. It was wrapped in ample bubble wrap inside the envelope in which it was delivered, which held no paperwork.",Really bright on 1 AA battery.

The overall build quality is that of a $20+ dollar light. It feels small in the hand, but very durable. The adjustable focus is very smooth, and the 3 operating modes (bright, dim, and bright strobe) and pretty easy to use. I've been using it for the past 3 nights to walk the dog, and am still on the first AA I put into it. Its been running for 45 minuets a night for 3 nights, with no visible change in brightness or distance. I am not using any special batteries, just plain generic brand AA's from my local Home Depot.

Pro: Super bright, adjustable focus, multiple operating modes, runs on 1 AA battery, all metal body construction

Cons: On/Off button can be a little hard to press while holding the light.

On a side note: shipping time to the states is rather long, as I believe it ships from somewhere in Asia.

This is a good light however so I'm really only deducting 2 stars because the stated output seems inflated.

The focus mechanism is useful but not particularly good at holding a focus setting - it's somewhat loose and just a slide mechanism. I like the fact that it feels sturdy, only needs 1 AA, has a an anti-roll design and can be stood up on it's tail so that the light is aimed upwards (e.g. at the ceiling). The cutouts on the head also allow you to place it lens down and you'll be able to easily recognize if you accidentally left it on as light will bleed through.","Bright enough light, can't possibly be 300 lumens"

As far as we're concerned, it is plenty bight and blows regular flashlights away. I was rather amazed at the light beam (adjustable) it offers. The scalloping on the nose protects the lens. I recommend using a rechargeable AA battery because it uses a bit of power to provide that nice beam. BUT after one uses the little powerhouse, the button on the end gets messed up and you have to disassemble it to get the loose spring properly aligned again. This happens with both of the ones we bought. They really should be pulled from the inventory because this issue really compromises the usability of the flashlight.

By the way, since the light supports both 1.2V NiMH batteries and 3.7V Li-ion batteries, I was hoping that there was an internal regulator. Well, there certainly is, but it isn't very effective. I used two batteries: a 2600 mAh 1.2V AA and a 900 mAh 3.7V 14500. If you do the math, you find that those batteries can deliver about equal power. But, the AA battery makes the light significantly dimmer. That means that the regulator isn't doing its job - if the flashlight was truly designed for both battery types, the regulator would drive the LED at the same voltage regardless of battery type. What happened here is probably that the light was designed for a Li-ion 14500 and someone noticed that it happens to work with an AA as well. The quality is NOT the same, and if there really is a CREE LED in here, it isn't being driven to its full potential.",Don't believe the title

did not receive my flashlights. They wrote back the next day and seemed friendly and helpful.
They said items may have been lost in shipping. They asked if I wanted a refund or to resend items.
I said resend as I already waited this long. Finally after more than 45 days I finally received these babies.

I don't know why but I just love it. As any flashaholic knows, a flashlight is personal, especially one of few that gets carried around every day. I think I like the feel and the grip and the wide flood the most. Highly recommend!

Now on to the more practical part of the review so people can make an educated decision:
- This indeed runs well and bright on a Liion 3.7V 14500 battery and is much brighter
- The 14500 battery doesn't last long; in fact it lasts a bit less than my 10440 in my Tank 703
- The zoom becomes a bit loose after a while but not in a bad way, just easier to move and more prone to move when you don't want it.
- Mine arrive in full working order, my father in law's arrived Dead and he had to RMA it. Set your expectations low and you will be surprised.
- When zoomed out it is a great soft and beautiful flood light. When zoomed in to around 80% it is nice and focused and a good beam pattern with soft edges. When fully zoomed in it is a large magnification of the emitter and an ugly square with lines just like the emitter is. It doesn't bother me but should be stated for those purists out there that look strongly at beam pattern.
- It is a little heavy light for its size and quite thick compared to most 14500 lights but also feels short (don't think it is though). It feels more like a CR123 light. Kinda cool and refreshing
- Reverse clicky (what would you expect for $5) but it is a good tailcap that can stand.
- Threads are fairly smooth but the spring catches as you unscrew and makes it feel gritty when it really isn't.
- Anodizing is surprisingly strong as I have it in my pocket with lots of other metal lights and knives and all the rest are now black and silver were the coating has rubbed off this is solid and nothing has come off in several months. Impressive!

Overall it isn't the most competent light on the planet and a far cry from a high-end fenix light but for $5 and all the things it does right I would highly recommend it. Worst case it is a conversation piece, best case it becomes your new EDC like me.",Surprisingly cool light and a great value!

For the price, we can put one of these in each vehicle(within driver's reach AND in the cargo area, so TWO in each vehicle) and all the other locations where I want a flashlight within arms length.

From a design standpoint, the clip on this light is extremely tight and forcing this over a pocket flap or slash pocket could result in some serious wear on the fabric, not to mention finger tips. The tactical grippy ribs just below the clip are darned pronounced, so it takes a bit of 'doing' to use the clip effectively. I don't commonly use the clip...I'll just carry the light or leave it in my pocket when not in use. I use this frequently when walking the Scottie-girl Katie. Naturally, it's not as bright as some of my 3xAAA lights; but this packs a might punch for its size. The focus feature is a little slippy, but it does the job if you're willing to hold it in place OR set the light in a stationary position.

This is the flashlight that I am ordering again. Ergo this review. In terms of cost and convenience, nothing beats this light.

At 10 feet, it throws a remarkably even 6 foot circle of light. None of my flashlights can do this. The button and button cover is flimsy, so what, I got duct tape.

There are multiple sellers for this item, and I suspect that the item quality may vary depending on the seller and the source/timing of their stock. I bought mine from Warm Mart around Oct 20. The item is shipped from Hong Kong, and took 2.5 weeks to arrive.

This little torch looks more expensive than the $5 I paid for it. It's made from metal, heavy (for its size), and has a tactical bezel that looks like it can be used to break glass.

The orange switch works reliably. There are other versions of this torch out there that has multiple settings - high, low, strobe. The one I received only has 2 settings though - on and off.

It only requires a single AA battery, which is nice. It works great with rechargeable NiMH batteries. I tried an Sanyo Eneloop rechargeable battery on the torch and left the light on to see how long it'll last - it lasted more that 4 hours on a single charge! I don't know exactly how long it lasted as I gave up checking after 4 hours. What's also amazing is that the brightness stays pretty constant over 3+ hours. Regular torchlights tend to get dimmer as its battery drains - not this one.

How bright is this torchlight? I have other LED torchlights for comparison - i.e. a typical pocket LED torch with 9 LEDs, running on 3xAAA and sells for a few dollars. This torchlight blows that one away - it's at least a couple of times brighter. It also emits a bright white light instead of the bluish-white light that other LED torchlights produce.

This torch also has a bezel that you can move in or out, to adjust the beam. On the 'wide' setting, it produces a very evenly lit circular spot. When used in the dark, the 'beam' setting will easily light up something that's 50+ feet away. The 'beam' setting looks strange though as it produces a squarish spot that is essentially an image of the Cree LED's surface.

It puts my other regular LED torches to shame. Wife initially balked when I bought another torchlight; when I turned it on, she wants me to buy a few more! A friend that I've shown it to now wants to get one.",Amazing little torch that is great value for money

Then it would go dark during my trip, and afterwards it wouldn't come on at all. This started after a total use of less than 3hrs. in strobe function, and the battery still had plenty of charge.

4,4,DenverDawg,4 people found this helpful. Was this review helpful to you?, October 24 2017,1.0 out of 5 stars,"I got this in June of this year. After less than four months, it's broken. Something is rattling around inside, it won't zoom in all the way any more, and there are two rubber band like things that (I'm guessing) used to be inside the flashlight and are very likely related to why it isn't working any more. My work backpack has a pocket on the shoulder strap. It had been in that pocket for maybe a month before I discovered it had broken.

This flashlight is not rugged. Not even a little. If clipping it on an office worker's backpack for a month breaks something... Well let's just say I'm glad I didn't get into a situation where I was relying on this light. Very glad.

Oh, and nothing at all on this product offering about warranty, how to return it, etc. Honestly, I wouldn't accept a replacement. Only a refund.

One other and less important gripe: The pocket clip is way too rigid and is really hard to get on anything. That's why I put it on the pocket on my backpack shoulder strap. I couldn't even get the clip over the edge of my jeans pocket without using a tool to pry it open.

Only minor quibble is that it's unclear when pressing the ""On"" button will turn on a solid light, versus turning on a rapidly-flashing light.
(Apparently the flashing light - which may or may not come on - is to confuse all those terrible criminals that are trying to attack you ... 'cause, you know, you're so likely to face that ""tactical"" situation.)
Other quibblette is that it'd be nice to be able to remove the pocket-clip (but it's attached with 2 unusual screws). On the other hand, if it was removed, then the flashlight would roll freely on any surface on which one might lay it - which would NOT be ""desirable"".

Extending the collar took a greater amount of effort over the first one and it snapped back upon releasing it. If there's an o-ring inside, it's too snug and is creating vacuum on extension. It doesn't snap back all the way leaving about one-eighth inch gap. The only way I could retract it all the way was by rotating the collar as I pressed down and as I pulled up. Eventually I could fully extend it and retract it with no issues. The same flashlight had a short issue with the switch. One day upon pressing the on-off button it flashed on momentarily then remained off. Pushing down on the button had no effect and the switch would not lock in position. It wouldn't even rotate to the next position. I Removed the switch portion from the main body and tapped it on a table and tried pressing again. No change. I eventually screwed the switch back figuring that it was broken. After screwing it back on I tried pushing the button one last time. It worked again!

1,1,FunMa of 3,One person found this helpful. Was this review helpful to you?, July 11 2017,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These mini LED flashlights are perfect for my little ones to use while we are out camping. They are heavy duty yet light and water resistant so they can withstand the rain (it always rains while camping). With these you have the ability to focus and adjust the intensity of light. There are 3 different modes: high beam, low beam and flashing and it only takes one AA battery. My son loves the handy built-in clip; he can clip the flashlight to his pant pocket, on his shirt or where ever it fancies him. Only flaw to me is that the clip is quite stiff so it can be difficult trying to clip it on but it definitely stays in place. Overall, these are great, sturdy little lights for the money. You get alot of light from such a small flashlight.",Great lights for a great price.

they're pretty dim, granting powered off a single, AAA battery. That's only 1.5v. their rather small size is appealing for storage in an automobile or a purse, i suppose. those were the purchase designs here, anyway or it's highly unlikely would have gone this route.

contacted the company twice, indicating one worked/one didn't. IDK yet if they've responded; I don't manage this account. my wife's account and I'm the occasional buyer. that said, looking at the order history, there's no clear Amazon indication that any adjustments have been made.

lastly, seems one can reasonably expect a hit & miss scenario with these -- notice the irregular pricing, strongly nudging a buyer toward a larger collection. to whit -- we bought a 2-pack for $9.99; now i see both that same 2-pack but also a 4-pack for $12.99.

Well, maybe a bigger flashlight. These things are tiny but crank an amazing amount of light given their size. Good for car, purse or pocket. Or to clip on your belt. The ability to focus the beam from narrow to wide is a plus. Be sure to wait for the sales. Prices are all over the map on these things, from as little as $8 (for 2) to almost $30.

So I find myself looking for smaller but strong and bright flashlights. These led flashlights from rockbirds are the perfect choice for my family. They are small and very sturdy. Strong and very bright. There are what I would call 3 different modes of light. The first is a regular flashlight beam. This light is very bright and shows a long distance from the user. Next is a more.focused beam just pull on the flashlight and you get a smaller more focused beam of light in a square. Next is a flashing mode. I like this one best because I will take the dogs for a walk in the morning before it is light out and I can use this in flashing mode attach it to my jacket so that drivers can see me.

I took off the clip (held on by two small allen screws) and applied some love with a pair of pliers and it works great again. I don't know if anyone else would have this problem and it's easy to fix, so it's not worth taking off a star. I may make a heavier clip for it myself though.

I use my flashlight in the house to check on eggs in an incubator so I pull the top of the flashlight out to narrow the scope. It is plenty bright for me to see the babies in the eggs. My husband has used his for lots of things in the tow truck. It is great for lots of jobs since it has adjustable lighting.

7,7,Spiced Rum,35 people found this helpful. Was this review helpful to you?, November 25 2016,5.0 out of 5 stars,"This is great flashlight for the price.

I got this flashlight for my toolbox in the truck. It works great, it’s small and economical.

This flashlight can run on either one of these batteries:
* 1 size AA (regular 1.5v battery), easy to find and cheap.
or
* 1 size 14500 (3.7v battery), harder to find and more expensive, but brighter.

Depending on the battery you use, the light is dimmer or brighter:
a) On a single AA battery, I would estimate 130 lumens. To me this is very bright on a single regular battery. I compared to another light I have that is advertized as 130 lumens by Energizer, it is very close to the same brightness in my opinion. To me 130 lumens is great task lighting.
b) On a single 14500 battery, the company claims 300 lumens and I believe it. 300 lumens is INTENSE, probably TOO much for task lighting. You likely would like this more for walking in the dark, where the light is out away from you more.

Other points:
a) Uses a 3 click switch. Press once for full brightness. Press quickly twice for1/2 brightness. 3 times for fast blinking at full bright.
b) The front of the flashlight pulls in/out to focus the beam. It works well and stays where you put it.
c) The light color is a slight shift towards blue from absolute white. But nothing extreme.
d) Has a tail cap pushbutton switch is encased in rubber. This is great for one-handed operation.
e) Doesn't easily do ""momentary on"". Momentary on is when it comes on by slightly pressing the switch and goes off when you release it. This light comes on when you release the button, not when you push it down. Fellow flashlight geeks call that a ""reverse clicky"".
f) Says it’s water resistant, but I doubt it is water proof. However, I didn’t dunk test it for water proof for fear of ruining it.",Great flashlight for the price

Was this review helpful to you?, June 10 2015,4.0 out of 5 stars,"It is a small and cheap LED flashlight, I actually bought several to keep everywhere in the car, office, and home just in case I need a flashlight. It is not 300 lumens, more like 100 lumens the most.
The battery life is adequate. The battery I put in 3 years still works (bought in 2012), I guess that means it doesn't just drain the power when not in use.
It is solid aluminum body and does have water proof o-ring. I did not submerge the flashlight, only used it in the rain and it seems to be fine, no electric shock experienced.
The ones I received have 3 modes: high, low and burst. HOWEVER, a simple shake of the flashlight changes the mode. For the price, I guess I should not be expecting a shock absorbing button or some sort, still annoying though.
You can change the focus of the flashlight but move the lens forward or backward. It will change the throw from a wider area to a more square center spot. AGAIN, the lens just slides, you have to hold it to keep the focus at what you like.
For the price, it is not bad, it turn on and stays on. As far as stay in the same mode and focus goes, you probably need to pay more for other flash light... If you want a flashlight that your life can depend on, then pay more to get a Nitecore, Fenix, Olight or even a Surefire.",You get what you paid for.

1,1,Dgihw,2 people found this helpful. Was this review helpful to you?, January 27 2015,2.0 out of 5 stars,"Absolutely love the flashlight, but it is not water resistant. The O rings are too loose. It let me down on a remote backcountry hike. It got damp in my daypack during a rainy day and would not work that night on the hike out. I took it apart the next week. There was obvious moisture/condensation around the LED. I let it dry out for a week and it started to work again. I believe the problem is with the seal on the focusing/zoom barrel and in the seal between the lens and the barrel. I put silicon grease on the barrel to give a better seal and super glued the lens in place. Hopefully this will help some, but I never hike with this flashlight without a backup when it is damp weather.
UPDATE: got some more of these, and the second batch is better. The O ring on the zoom is much tighter. Maybe this is a fix, or just an example of loose quality control. If the zoom slides easily -- send it back. If it has some resistance, then the O ring seal is probably good.",NOT Waterproof - not even very water resistant

They're solid, and after about a year, are all working as new. Since I got so many I was able to tell that some of the zooms slide smoothly and easily, others are barely movable. Zoomed all the way in (smallest beam spread) the beam is nearly square, the same geometry as the LED chip. That is, the LED chip is projected in detail at full zoom, as you zoom out the beam quickly becomes round. With a new AA battery, the most tightly zoomed beam will reach over 100 feet with adequate illumination of the target in my opinion. The word target refers only to whatever is illuminated by the beam, and isn't intended to imply that this light should or could work as a firearm accessory.

The mounting clips on some use allen head screws, others use el-cheapo phillips pig iron screws. I removed the clips from all of them because they are sort of sharp, and in the way.

If they were of more consistent quality, I'd give five stars. However as far as the switches and the illumination, they are nearly identical. That is a good thing since the switches are solid feeling, and the illumination is even and bright. They chew through a AA battery pretty fast. I get about 1.5 hours from a good quality alkaline (i.e. Duracell, Energizer).

I bought this on a whim, and I must say I am thrilled. It is small enough to fit compactly in your hand and use as a strike enhancer in a self defense situation if need be. (For those who are untrained or inexperienced in proper punching techniques, squeezing an object like this, or a roll of quarters, dimes, lighter, etc... can assist in preventing weak/limp-wristed strikes/punches) When held in such a manner the switch can be activated with your thumb, and the semi pointed tip can be used with some effectiveness when delivering hammer punches.

A half push of the button switches modes while a full push turns the light on or off. The first mode is full brightness, then half brightness, then full brightness but strobe/blinking mode. The beam of the light can be focused with a telescopic feature at the head of the light where the bulb is (instead of the typical twist to focus the beam of light). This method of focusing the light is actually much better for my frequent uses because it is very quick and easy to change how focused I need the light to be (with just two fingers instead of two hands).
This flashlight can easily be operated while wearing thick winter gloves. In the instances when you'll need both hands, this flashlight is just small enough so that you could use your teeth (its heavy so you'll have to bite hard but don't forget metal is tougher than your teeth... unless you WANT to file your teeth down)

The light output isn't as bright as some other flashlights in the same price range but this is actually a good thing because I will get much more time out of the battery. I don't like carrying extra batteries but you'll need to do that with the brighter flashlights because one AA can only give you 2-4hours but this flashlight lets me go about 6+hours before I notice a significant dimmer light. Costco sells a duracell brand flashlight (pack of 3) for a similar price but that light is even bulkier, heavier, and uses way more batteries.

With the advances of CREE LEDs small flashlights are much more powerful now.

Pros:
Small size easily fits into my pants pocket.
Nice strong clip that can secure it to most belts.
Bright adjustable light that can light up the sides of a 4 story building and focus in like a spot light.
Stupid bright light that can light up the darkest of EMS scenes without holding up a huge flash light.
Price you cant beat it!
The on and off button is set up so it wont turn on by mistake in my pocket like other flashlights I have.

Cons:
-It runs on one AA battery which with extended use will drain quickly so be sure to have a extra battery on hand.
-The dam thing took 4 weeks to ship from China. After looking around on Amazon this same model ships from sellers in the USA but the price is a few dollars more.
-The parts will unscrew if your not careful. The easy way to fix this is to make sure all the parts of the light are twisted on tightly.

This flashlight is on par with the 5.11 taclight I own and my Surefire Light for a fraction of the money. I lost a 50 dollar 5.11 flashlight one night in the snow at a car accident. This flashlight is so cheap you can afford to loose it and still feel good about buying a new one.",Nice durable small flashlight

6,6,David S. Shores,Was this review helpful to you?, February 6 2014,5.0 out of 5 stars,You can't get a better light for the price! This light uses a AA battery and the alkaline lasts way longer than my rechargeables li ions I have!!!,Great deal!!!
7,7,Priscilla,Was this review helpful to you?, February 5 2014,5.0 out of 5 stars,"This flashlight is terrific. The light is very bright and quality is tops.
The price is unbelievable. We bought 5 to have them available on each floor of our home and in each car. Definitely recommend this item.",Wonderful
8,8,skeeter,Was this review helpful to you?, February 4 2014,5.0 out of 5 stars,I really have no idea how they can make this machined aluminum light with the many parts from different sources and sell/ship for this money! 1AA bat does the job for me. Very nice. Heck the shipping in U.S.A. costs more than this!,excellent
9,9,Richard Easle,Was this review helpful to you?, February 3 2014,5.0 out of 5 stars,Excellent value for the money. Work great and is very bright for a little light. I bought several and plan to put them in every car.,Well worth the Money

1,1,Josh,Was this review helpful to you?, February 1 2014,3.0 out of 5 stars,"You'll get a flashlight all right, but the quality will be somewhat random. In my case, the features across the 4 flashlights I ordered were different: One just didn't have the strobe option, and one didn't have any options. If I hadn't ordered 4 of the same flashlights, I'd swear I ordered them incorrectly.",A toss up
2,2,Jordan S.,Was this review helpful to you?, January 30 2014,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I've carried it every day in my pocket since I received it. Use it at least once every day, super bright. At least twice as bright as my regular 3 Cell C Maglite with a much more even light pattern.

I was so please with this cheap little light that I bought a bunch more to give to family and friends.

After carrying it daily for 2 months now it still works great and still on the first battery.","Really bright for running off a single AA battery. Very slow shipping, came from China and took a month."
3,3,FaCS teacher,Was this review helpful to you?, January 24 2014,5.0 out of 5 stars,"For something as inexpensive as this was, it works well. The clip on it is the one thing that distinguishes it form most of the other ones I see. It has a very bright light. The only problem I had was mine, not the products - it took me a while to figure out where and how to get it open to stick a battery in it.",simply works
4,4,An Informed Buyer,Was this review helpful to you?, January 21 2014,4.0 out of 5 stars,"The power button on mine protrudes a little too far out of the end, making it hard for the flash to stand on its own on the floor/desk. I own a couple of similar looking flashlights that don't have this problem. I don't know who made that produding button, SODIAL brand or the seller HFHF INC.

Other than that, the flash works fine. It uses the same Cree LED and aluminum shell as all of the other brands. The flash is very bright initially, but loses much of the luminance after about half an hour of usage. After about an hour, it gets really warm to the touch, and the light is barely visible. If I let it run all the way, then the flash would blink, indicating that the battery is out. Note that I use rechargeable NIMH AA battery.",Wobbly when stands up on its own
5,5,Tyler D,Was this review helpful to you?, January 16 2014,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I ordered the rechargeable batteries along with this. It eats the batter FAST and gets really hot after a few minutes of use. But hey, for the price I can blind someone 100 yards away.",Cheap but extremely bright
6,6,Ipilot,Was this review helpful to you?, January 15 2014,5.0 out of 5 stars,Bought 8 of these for Christmas presents. Nice light output with the AA battery. Very compact and fit easily in a pocket.,Great deal
7,7,Karlo,Was this review helpful to you?, January 12 2014,4.0 out of 5 stars,"This is a nice, bright flashlight with good battery life. However, only a few weeks after I got it the switch started to fail. Now if I turn it off I have to wait a while before I can turn it back on again, which is pretty annoying.",normal product
8,8,KC Jayhawk,Was this review helpful to you?, January 9 2014,4.0 out of 5 stars,"These turned out to be great little flashlights - bright even with a AA alkaline battery and really bright with a lithium ion battery.

9,9,adger,Was this review helpful to you?, January 7 2014,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I have two of these lights, and use them every day. They are the brightest flashlights you are likely to find for that price.

They are shipped from China, so it takes a long time to get here, but well worth the wait.

Only gripe is that battery life isn't very long, and there is no low power option, but I'm happy with mine.",I use it daily
0,0,Sean,Was this review helpful to you?, January 7 2014,3.0 out of 5 stars,"It's ok. Good amount of light although very narrow beam which doesn't adjust. Sometimes doesn't light up so you have to smack it a little bit before it'll turn on. Tried changing the batteries and same thing happens. It's just ok, but good for the price. It's no Nebo Redline.","Not bad, not the best"
1,1,Deputy Dog rs,Was this review helpful to you?, January 4 2014,4.0 out of 5 stars,Great little flashlight for the money. I always keep a few extras at home to give as gifts. Very bright for its size. Great to drop in a pocket and forget until you need it. Only drawback is that it takes a while to get since it ships from overseas.,Great value for a bright little light
2,2,DJD,One person found this helpful. Was this review helpful to you?, January 3 2014,2.0 out of 5 stars,"I have surefire lights that are rated at 320 lumens, and this light does not even come close.

I bought 3. 2 failed within a week.

The ""zoom"" feature is really a cheap metal cylinder holding the horrible lens that slides forward and back which will eventually become very loose.

In spotlight mode, the very center of the beam all you see is a square that is a reflection of the square CREE LED die and is very distracting.

For a good pocket EDC light, get an Olight i3s. yes, at $22 its a bit more than this light but it's reliable, has superior optics, is smaller, has terrific build quality , and will run forever on a single AAA battery.","Definitely not 300lm, construction is so-so, get an Olight I3S instead"
3,3,pixa00,Was this review helpful to you?, January 3 2014,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Flashlight works fine, but the clip is not connected with the right small screws -- when trying to use it the clip gets disconnected and the screws are falling out, But the price and flashlight functionality make this item a good bargain.",Great price for extra bright flashlight

2,2,Allen,One person found this helpful. Was this review helpful to you?, December 15 2013,2.0 out of 5 stars,"This mini flashlight may be inexpensive, but it is junk. Uses 1 AA battery so not nearly as bright as the same LED powered by 3 AA batteries (see the ""Lighting Ever"" zoom flashlight with the same CREE LED). The adjustable zoom is not at all smooth, requires using your other hand to pull on the collar. The lens is low quality, creates non-uniform lighting with a bright ring outside a dark band. Pay a few more dollars and buy an excellent alternative. I bought 1 of these just to compare to the Lighting Ever zoom model (bought 2 of those, and love it). Also takes forever to receive this junk, shipped from China.",Junk
3,3,Se'iz Mir Gitt,Was this review helpful to you?, December 15 2013,5.0 out of 5 stars,"For the price I paid, I got a lot of 'bang for my buck'. Metal casing feels strong, only uses 1 battery, it has 2 brightness settings plus a blinking setting, you can adjust the size of the beam, includes a pocket clip and fits in the palm of your hand. I wouldn't recommend it for heavy duty use since it will get lost due to it's size, the adjustable tip will come off and it's not very bright, but for around the house its great.",handy small flashlight
4,4,Ron,Was this review helpful to you?, December 14 2013,4.0 out of 5 stars,"This is exactly as described. Takes single AA, focus beam, and on/off switch.
But if you want selectable click with dim and flash you need to get this one: ""CREE Q5 3W Led 350 Lumens mini Flashlight Zoomable Torch AA"". This version has the three different modes when clicking. Though it didn't have a memory of the previous mode and doesn't do temp on when partial pressed.
Sorry, back to this version... It is a very nice light for the money and even though the shipping time from China is a couple weeks it is still a great light.","Can't beat the R.O.I on this, excellent value!"
